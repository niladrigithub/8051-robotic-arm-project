# 8051 Robotic Arm Project

![Robotic Arm](robotic_arm_image.png)

## Overview

This project utilizes the 8051 microcontroller to control a robotic arm through assembly code. The assembly code includes the main program (`main.asm`) and specific code for servo motor control (`servo_control.asm`).

## Project Structure

- **Assembly_Code:** Contains the assembly code files for the project.
  - `main.asm`: Main program logic for the 8051 microcontroller.
  - `servo_control.asm`: Code for controlling the servo motor.

- **Documentation:** Includes project-related documentation.
  - `project_report.pdf`: Detailed project report providing insights into the design, implementation, and results.

## Usage

1. **Setting up the Development Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary tools and software to compile and program the 8051 microcontroller with assembly code.
   - [Add any specific instructions here.]

2. **Programming the Microcontroller:**
   - Load the `main.asm` and `servo_control.asm` files onto the 8051 microcontroller.
   - [Add any specific instructions here.]

3. **Running the Robotic Arm:**
   - Power on the 8051 microcontroller.
   - Observe the robotic arm's movements based on the programmed logic.
   - [Add any specific instructions here.]
